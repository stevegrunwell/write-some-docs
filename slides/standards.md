### Learn the standards used by your project

Note:

While PHPDoc is pretty common, different projects may have different conventions for things like alignment, phrasing, or the handling of certain tags.

For example, WordPress asks that you *not* use `@return void` — if there's no return, omit the DocBlock tag.

Knowing the conventions used by your project will make documentation far less painful.
