### Inline Documentation

```php
/**
 * Definition for the Person class.
 *
 * @package MyPackage
 * @author  ACME, Inc.
 */

namespace ACME\MyPackage\Person;
```

Note:

File-level DocBlocks are also great to help people understand the context of a file, and are another form of inline documentation.
