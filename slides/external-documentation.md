### External Documentation

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Public-facing documentation
	* User guides
	* API documentation
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Internal documentation
	* README files
	* Wikis

Note:

When the documentation isn't intermingled with the code — even if it co-exists in the repository — we refer to it as "external" documentation.

External documentation can take multiple forms, whether they're tutorials or guides to help users use your product or API documentation to help developers integrate with your service.

External documentation doesn't need to be public at all; maybe you have a README file in your repository or an internal wiki for your team. These locations still contain important pieces of knowledge.
