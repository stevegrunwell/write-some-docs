### Generate documentation regularly

* Coverage <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Detect duplication or spaghetti code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Even if your codebase isn't being distributed, regularly generating documentation can have some benefits:

Generated docs will help highlight areas of the codebase that don't have documentation and could benefit from more attention. PHPDocumentor includes reports for areas that are either missing or don't have sufficient coverage.

Getting a high-level view of your app can also help you recognize possible code organization issues and find things like duplicated functionality or features you had forgotten about.
