### Generate documentation regularly

* Coverage <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Detect duplication or spaghetti code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Even if your codebase isn't being distributed, regularly generating documentation can have some benefits:

Generated docs will help highlight areas of the codebase that don't have documentation and could benefit from more attention.

Getting a high-level view of your app can also help you recognize possible code organization issues and find things like duplicated functionality or features you had forgotten about.
