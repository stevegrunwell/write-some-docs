### Be careful about your assumptions

* Don't assume intimate knowledge <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Link to relevant docs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

It's important to write our documentation in a way that we're not assuming the reader has intimate knowledge of the entire codebase. We don't want to talk-down, either, but imagine the person understands the language but only has high-level knowledge of the concept.

If additional information is necessary, point people in the right direction.
