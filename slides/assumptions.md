### Be careful about your assumptions

* Don't assume intimate knowledge <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Link to relevant docs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Hard to document? Could be a code smell! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

It's important to write our documentation in a way that we're not assuming the reader has intimate knowledge of the entire codebase.

If additional information is necessary, point people in the right direction.

If your code can't be documented easily, that could be a sign that your code is poorly organized or overly complex.
