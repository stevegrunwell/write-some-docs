### Inline Documentation

* Documentation within the code itself
* Describes what everything does, function inputs/outputs, etc.
* Written for a developer audience

Note:

Inline documentation is the code we write in the codebase itself, and where we describe what arguments are accepted by a function, how something works, and anything people need to know in order to integrate with our code.
