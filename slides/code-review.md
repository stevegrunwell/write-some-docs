### Make documentation part of code review

* Code changes should always include relevant changes to documentation <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Forces team to write docs for new features <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Protects documentation from falling behind <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

A practice I love to see is making documentation part of code review

New arguments added but not documented? No documentation for new functionality? Send it back!
