### When do I write documentation?

* As — or even before — you write your code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* When questions are raised or bugs found <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* When refactoring <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Whenever documentation is insufficient <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Ideally, documentation should be written before you write any code. This forces you to think about your approach, and sometimes saying it out loud (or typing it) can help you catch logical errors.

If bugs or stress-cases are found, make sure these are documented!

When refactoring code, make sure the documentation stays up-to-date.

If you find yourself having to read the code to figure out what a function does, that's a sign that the documentation isn't doing it's job. Take what you've learned and write it down!
