### For Ourselves

* Help ourselves remember how and why something works
* Catch issues with our approach before writing any code
* Better documentation => fewer questions


Note:

Of course, this doesn't mean we can't benefit ourselves from having good documentation. Documentation helps us remember how or why something works the way it does, and writing documentation just before we write the code can help us catch code smells before they stink up the codebase.
