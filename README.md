# ![Still from the 1971 "I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke" advertising campaign](resources/banner.jpg) I'd Like to Write the World Some Docs

It takes a special kind of person to enjoy writing documentation; not only do I have to write [ideally] working code, but now I have to write words that a human being can understand? What is this madness?!

Luckily, good documentation lives on outside your codebase. By following common documentation standards, we can generate comprehensive manuals that instruct others how to integrate with our software. After all, to code is human, but to document is divine.
